# React Formly

[![build](https://travis-ci.org/kentcdodds/react-formly.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/kentcdodds/react-formly)

JSON powered forms for react. Currently in development. Feel free to play around with it! It actually works remarkably
well. The tests are the best documentation so far. I'll update these docs when I get more time. See
[the demo](http://kent.doddsfamily.us/react-formly) for an example of basic usage.
